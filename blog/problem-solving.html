            "Problem-solving skills" is a buzzword that's probably on every
            developer resume on earth. It's important that we learn how to turn
            this ambigious concept into something more methodical and actionable
            for ourselves as developers.

            Ah yes, nothing like your function being completely correct except
            for 1 missing keyword. In one of the JavaScript Kata exercises, all
            of the logic in my function was working, except for the fact that it
            wasn't returning the value that I had so carefully prepared for it.
            Thankfully for the <code>test.js</code> file for that exercise, I
            was quickly able to figure out the solution i.e. adding
            <code>return</code> before my variable ðŸ¤¯ It's funny how simple the
            solution is sometimes, and it really speaks to how important proper
            testing and error logging are.

          <p class="body-txt">
            In the JavaScript Kata repo, there was a stretch exercise in the
            Gradebook section. It essentially combined 2 separate solutions from
            previous exercises in the section. At first I just copied and pasted
            them in and the tests were passing, but I had a feeling that there
            was a more efficient way to solve the problem. Long story short
            turns out there was a way to combine the 2 functions into a single
            solution. It really taught me the importance of refactoring your
            code after writing the initial approach. After reviewing things for
            a second time, there are often efficiencies you spot that might not
            have seemed obvious at first.

            I'm confident will all of the problem-solving techniques we have
            learnt about so far. But by far my most used techniques are console
            logging, error messages, Googling and pseudocode. In saying that I
            think there's always an added level of discomfort when you're
            reaching out to peers or coaches for help, since it feels like you
            might be judged for asking a 'stupid' question. It's also a tricky
            situation because a lot of people in the industry talk about the
            importance of juniors trying to figuring something out for
            themselves, but that also needs to be balanced with recognising when
            you genuinely need help. I haven't felt the need to ask for help
            just yet, but when I do I'll probably need to give myself a bit of a
            pep talk and remind myself that it's fine to ask questions.

            Earlier in Foundations I was receiving a warning when opening my
            terminal <code>npm warn Unknown user config "python"</code>. I've
            been using npm for a while and had never had that warning appear,
            but since I followed the Dev Academy setup instructions I decided
            that I would just leave it since it wasn't causing any issues. A few
            other students posted about it and the issue was solved, and
            hopefully instructions are updated for future cohorts. In hindsight
            I should have just asked about it since other people were having the
            same problem!
