          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Whether it’s for developers, browsers or screen readers, part of
            writing good HTML is describing it’s content. Basic HTML tags can do
            the trick, but sometimes they aren’t enough for all of the possible
            elements we have on our pages. We might have a
            <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>
            element that needs to trigger a custom JavaScript function, or a
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element that needs to look different to the
            rest of the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements on a page - this is
            where HTML ID and Class attributes are helpful.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Multiple HTML elements can share the same Class, and the same
            element can have multiple Classes.

            describes the Class attribute as something that is often used to
            point to a Class name in a CSS style sheet. It can also be used by
            JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific Class
            name.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            In contrast to the Class attribute, you cannot have more than one
            element with the same ID in an HTML document, and elements can only
            have a single ID value. They can also be used to point to a specific
            style in a CSS document, but are more commonly used by JavaScript to
            access and manipulate the elements (more on this later).

          <h3 class="blog-sctn-head"><strong>HOW TO NAME THEM</strong></h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            There are a range of different naming conventions for ID and
            Classes, some based on technical limitations and some on personal
            opinions.
          </p>
          <ul class="flex col blog-list">
            <li class="body-txt">
              Classes cannot contain whitespace characters, otherwise browsers
              will treat them as two seperate classes.
            </li>
            <li class="body-txt">
              IDs should also not contain whitespace characters. browsers treat
              this as if the whitespace is part of the ID which means they have
              to be escaped manually in CSS and JavaScript (something that is
              not best practice).
            </li>
            <li class="body-txt">
              Technically IDs and Classes can contain any other Unicode
              characters. However when using CSS selectors in stylesheets or
              JavaScript APIs like <code>Document.querySelector()</code>, the ID
              and Class values must be valid CSS identifiers. To avoid issues it
              is best practice to name them according as valid CSS identifiers,
              you can read more about valid CSS identifiers with examples

            <li class="body-txt">
              While this isn’t a technical requirement, web developers are
              encouraged to use names that describe the semantic purpose of the
              element. For example, instead of using generic names like
              <code>div1</code> or <code>element2</code>, choose more
              descriptive names like <code>header-section</code> or
              <code>submit-button</code>.
            </li>
            <li class="body-txt">
              While there are differing opinions on how to format names, the
              general consensus is to use lowercase letters with hyphens e.g.
              <code>main-content</code> (also called kebab-case). However some
              developers may use <code>snake_case</code>,
              <code>camelCase</code>, or methodologies like
              <a href="https://getbem.com/" target="_blank">BEM</a> in larger
              projects.

            <strong>WHEN TO USE THEM</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Although this can differ by developer and project, the general rule
            is to use Classes for styling and IDs for functionality. When I
            first started learning how to code, there was so much information to
            take in that I just followed what everyone else was doing, and
            didn’t take the time to properly research the “why” until now. There
            are 3 key reasons for this:
          </p>
          <ul class="flex col blog-list">
            <li class="body-txt">
              Classes are reusable and flexible (just because an element starts
              out unique, it may not stay that way)
            </li>
            <li class="body-txt">
              IDs have a higher CSS specificity than Classes, making them harder
              to override which can cause problems in larger
              stylesheets/codebases
            </li>
            <li class="body-txt">
              Styling everything with Classes means developers don’t need to
              constantly stop and decide whether it is appropriate to include
              something as an ID or Class.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="body-txt">
            This begs the question of when it is appropriate to use IDs:
          </p>
          <ul class="flex col blog-list">
            <li class="body-txt">
              When you want to target something with JavaScript e.g.
              <code>document.getElementById()</code>
            </li>
            <li class="body-txt">
              When you want to add an ID fragment to an HTML element so that you
              can navigate to it using a URL
              <code>e.g .../page#my-section-id</code>
            </li>
            <li class="body-txt">
              For form functionality and accessibility e.g. giving an
              <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element an <code>id</code>, so a
              <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element can point to it using the
              <code>for</code> attribute
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="body-txt">
            With a few exceptions, I think it can be boiled down to this simple
            quote from a user on
            <a

            - “In general I use classes for everything and IDs only when I need
            to interact with an element using js”.

          <p class="body-txt">
            Understanding when and how to use IDs and Classes is key to writing
            clean HTML that integrates seamlessly with CSS and JavaScript. By
            sticking to consistent naming conventions and clear use cases, we
            can facilitate cleaner and more maintainable codebases.
