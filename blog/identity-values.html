            <strong>DEALING WITH ETHICAL DECISIONS</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            My partner and I recently spent a month in Istanbul, Turkey. As we
            were walking back to our apartment one evening we noticed a couple
            arguing. We soon realised that the woman was trying to leave and the
            man was refusing. He wasn't being violent, but kept blocking her
            path and at one point even lifted her back to where she had been
            standing.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Our instinct was to check whether she needed help but we found
            ourselves in a dilemma - intervene and cause a misunderstanding, or
            leave and continue with our day. We couldn't speak Turkish, were
            worried about overstepping cultural boundaries/social norms, and
            weren't sure if the man would get violent if we stepped in.
          </p>

          <p class="body-txt">
            We decided to approach the woman. Our thought process was that it
            was better for us to check and her say it was fine, than for us to
            walk away if it wasn't. She nervously laughed it off and said she
            was fine, so we left feeling that there wasn't much more we could
            do.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Although at the time I was unsure, reflecting on the decision now I
            think we made the right choice. We all assume we won't fall victim
            to the bystander effect, but when you're in the moment it's not so
            simple.

            <strong>MY CULTURE AND THE PEOPLE AROUND ME</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Born in Aotearoa, I'm half Fijian-Indian and half New Zealand
            European. My family and cultures have played a huge part in shaping
            the person that I am today.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            My mum immigrated from Fiji when she was 16, with no family or
            friends in the country. She worked part-time at the supermarket to
            to pay board with a family in Wellington while she went to high
            school. My dad was born and raised in Auckland. With no formal
            tertiary education he eventually found himself as a cable runner at
            TVNZ, by the end of his career he was retiring as the Director of
            Broadcasting for SKY TV. My parents and grandparents passed down
            knowledge and values that are at the core of who I am today.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            I took some time to take a step back and reflect on what my values
            are, including tests on
            <a href="http://personalvalu.es" target="_blank">personalvalu.es</a>
            and
            <a href="https://azimuthpsych.com/" target="_blank"
              >azimuthpsych.com</a
            >. Deep down I think I already had a pretty clear view on what is
            important to me, but it was a great reminder of what motivates me in
            life.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Work hard, take care of your family, apply yourself, be kind and
            compassionate, strive for excellence, look after your health, live
            life to the fullest, and enjoy it (all cheesy but true). It's only
            during writing this that it really sunk in just how much I am a
            product of my environment, and I'm grateful that this was the
            environment I was raised in.

            <strong>MY STRENGTHS AND HOW THEY WILL SUPPORT ME</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Being mindful of my strengths (and limitations) will be a big part
            of ensuring that my learning journey is efficient, enjoyable and
            meaningful.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Again I think that these were things that I inherently knew, but it
            was helpful to refresh myself on what comes naturally to me and
            where I can improve. Above all I think my biggest strength is my
            passion for software and desire to pursue it as a career. I took the
            DOPE Personality test on
            <a
              href="https://richardstep.com/dope-personality-type-quiz/dope-bird-4-personality-types-test-questions-online-version/"
              target="_blank"
              >richardstep.com</a
            >, the
            <a href="https://www.viacharacter.org/" target="_blank"
              >VIA Strength Test</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://bigfive-test.com/" target="_blank"
              >The Big Five test</a
            >. My DOPE result was the Dove, who is considered
            "people-orientated, loyal, friendly, hard-working and a great team
            player". This and the other tests helped me pin down 5 key traits
            that I consider strengths.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Humility keeps me open to feedback and stops my ego from getting in
            the way of learning. Integrity ensures I am honest with myself about
            how I am progressing and whether I am giving 100% effort.
            Perseverance will help me push through challenges and difficult
            times. Diligence means showing up everyday and applying myself to
            the best of my ability. Communication will make group learning more
            productive and enjoyable.

          <h3 class="blog-sctn-head">
            <strong>MY LIMITATIONS AND HOW THESE MIGHT AFFECT ME</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            I'm a big believer that identifying our weaknesses and areas for
            improvement is as important (if not more important) than our
            strengths. My aim is to be honest and mindful about these areas, so
            that I can stay present, focused and productive during the course.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Coming back to my DOPE Personality result (the Dove) - while they
            have some great traits they also tend to avoid change,
            confrontation, risk-taking and assertiveness. In addition to this
            I've identified some key areas where I can improve.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            I am working on getting used to the “just in time” learning model,
            and often get tempted to deep-dive into topics and get sidetracked.
            Being a perfectionist is something that I struggle with, and can
            result in me sinking a lot of time into tasks that aren't high
            value. I'm naturally introverted, so I'd like to manage this and
            prevent it from getting in the way of applying myself. Lastly I'd
            like to try working on approaching life in general with more
            appreciation, excitement and energy.

          <h3 class="blog-sctn-head">
            <strong>WORKING PRODUCTIVELY WITH OTHERS</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            In a previous job I was responsible for managing a monthly billing
            process, capturing all of the costs that needed to be invoiced
            across our clients. The challenge was that some team members
            repeatedly missed deadlines, which put pressure on the whole team.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            I raised this with them several times but had no luck. My first
            approach was to send out a group reminder every month, a week ahead
            of our due date. Unfortunately after several months with little
            improvement I started to take ownership of the additional billing
            work.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            At a surface level it felt like it was working, we were meeting our
            deadlines and I developed a lot of experience in this space. However
            I soon realised that it was more like a plaster that masked the
            symptoms of a bigger underlying issue. Workload and technical
            knowledge was not being spread across everyone, which left the team
            vulnerable if I wasn't there (and put more pressure on me).
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            In hindsight, I think it would have been better to escalate the
            challenge to management earlier so we could work on a longer-term,
            more sustainable solution.
