            <strong>MY LONG TERM CAREER GOAL</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            The goal is to pursue a career in Engineering, working with
            technologies and products that I feel passionately about. At this
            stage I would prefer to take a technical route as opposed to a
            managerial path.

            <strong>MY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            My biggest strength is my passion for software and drive to pursue
            it as a career. Other traits that I think will serve me well during
            my learning journey are humility, integrity, perseverance,
            diligence, and communication.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            At the same time I need to be mindful of my limitations. I lean
            towards being a perfectionist, tend to avoid risk and confrontation,
            get tempted to deep-dive into topics that aren’t necessarily
            productive, and would consider myself naturally introverted. I’m
            hoping that by identifying these traits early I can proactively work
            on them and ensure I’m applying myself and getting the most out of
            this experience.

            <strong>SKILLS I‘D LIKE TO DEVELOP</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            While there are always new technical skills to learn and that is
            something that excites me, I think the main gap for me is practical
            experience coding in a team environment. I’m looking forward to
            honing this area of my skillset so I can efficiently work with other
            developers on projects.

            <strong>WORKLOAD AND COLLABORATION</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            I’m currently managing my workload by setting clear boundaries in my
            daily routine around what time will be dedicated to Dev Academy. I'm
            also setting clear goals each day, making sure to not over-commit so
            I can focus on quality rather than fast learning.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            I plan on collaborating with other students, helping each other
            where we can and facilitating the teina/teina learning approach
            mentioned in the prep curriculum. We all come from different
            backgrounds and are at different stages of the learning journey, and
            I’m committed to respecting everyone whether they are learner,
            facilitator or industry representative.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            If I feel that things are starting to get too much, I will take a
            step back to prioritise and ask for guidance where needed. I plan on
            taking regular breaks to prevent burnout, and will be optimising
            things like sleep and diet to ensure I am operating at my best.

            <strong>SEEKING HELP</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            If I find myself struggling I will find a balance between trying to
            figure something out myself (since this is an essential part of
            being a programmer), and being honest with myself about when I need
            help. When I do need to reach out to a facilitator, I will post my
            question in the <code>#foundations-helpdesk</code> Discord channel
            using the template provided in the prep curriculum, or if
            appropriate directly message my facilitator.

          <p class="body-txt">
            I expect the facilitation team to guide and challenge me throughout
            this journey, to make sure that I am getting the most out of the
            experience and leaving as prepared as I can be to enter the
            industry. At the same time I acknowledge they have their own
            workload and lives going on, so I will be respectful and
            understanding of their other commitments.

          <p class="body-txt">
            I’m extremely fortunate that I have no other strict time commitments
            at this time. While I plan to remain focused on taking care of
            myself mentally and physically, Dev Academy is my sole focus and my
            aim is to make the most of this experience.
