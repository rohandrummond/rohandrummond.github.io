            <strong>MY LONG TERM CAREER GOAL</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            I would like to pursue a career in engineering, working with
            technologies and products that I feel passionately about. At this
            stage I would prefer to take a technical route to Senior Engineer
            and above, rather than a managerial route into Engineering
            management.

            <strong>MY STRENGHTS AND LIMITATIONS</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            My biggest strength is my passion for software and drive to pursue
            it as a career. Other traits that I think will serve me well during
            my learning journey are humility, integrity, perseverance,
            diligence, and communication.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            At the same time I need to be mindful of my limitations. I lean
            towards being a perfectionist, tend to avoid risk and confrontation,
            get tempted to deep-dive into topics that aren’t necessarily
            productive, and would consider myself naturally introverted. I’m
            hoping that by identifying these traits early I can proactively
            working on them I can make sure that I’m applying myself and getting
            the most out of this experience.

            <strong>SKILLS I‘D LIKE TO DEVELOP</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            hile there are always new technical skills to learn and that is
            something that excites me, I think the main gap in my current
            experience is being able to code in a team environment that
            resembles what is required in real industry roles. I’m looking
            forward to honing this area of my skillset so I can efficiently work
            with other developers on projects.

            <strong>MANAGING MY WORKLOAD</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            I’m currently managing my workload by setting clear boundaries in my
            daily routine around what time will be dedicated to Dev Academy. I
            am setting clear goals each day, making sure to not over-commit so I
            can focus on quality rather than fast learning.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            I plan on collaborating with other students, helping each other
            where we can and facilitating the teina/teina learning approach
            mentioned in the prep curriculum. We all come from different
            backgrounds and stages in life, and I’m committed to respecting
            everyone whether they are learner, facilitator or industry
            representative.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            If I feel that things are starting to get too much, I will take a
            step back to prioritise and ask for guidance where needed. I plan on
            taking regularl breaks to prevent burnout, and will be optimising
            things like sleep and diet to ensure I am operating at my best.

            <strong>SEEKING HELP</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            If I find myself struggling I will find a balance between trying to
            figure something out myself (since this is an essential part of
            being a programmer), and being honest with myself about when I need
            help. When I do need to reach out to a facilitator, I will post my
            question in the <code>#foundations-helpdesk</code> Discord channel
            using the template provided in the prep curriculum, or if
            appropriate directly message my facilitator.

            <strong>FACILITATOR EXPECTATIONS</strong>

          <p class="body-txt">
            I expect the facilitation team to guide and challenge me throughout
            the learning process, ensuring that I am getting the most out of the
            programme and leaving as prepared as I can be to enter the industry.
            At the same time I acknowledge they have their own workload and
            lives going on, so I will be respectful and understanding of their
            other commitments.

          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            I’m fortunate enough to have no other commitments at this point in
            my life. While I plan to remain focused on taking care of myself
            mentally and physically, Dev Academy is my sole focus and I plan to
            make the most of this experience.
