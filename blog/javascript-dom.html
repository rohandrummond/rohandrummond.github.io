            I first dove into the world of web development through a course on
            Udemy. It was from a bootcamp in London called The App Brewery, and
            it took me all the way from HTML to modern JavaScript frameworks
            like React and Express. I had heard so much about JavaScript but
            really had no idea what it was used for, it was also my first time
            being introduced to programming concepts like control flow and
            loops. It was a rocky start, but it's where my love for programming
            started so let's get into it!

            <strong>HOW JAVASCRIPT RELATES TO HTML AND CSS</strong>

          <p class="body-txt">
            I remember someone trying to explain that JavaScript let's you add
            functionality to a page, and for someone new to web development that
            definition didn't really sink in for me. An analogy that makes sense
            to me is to think of a web page a house.

            <li class="body-txt">
              CSS: The interior and exterior design of the house (e.g. paint,

              for turning on your AC unit)

            In saying this, part of my programming journey has been learning to
            accept that things might not make perfect sense straightaway, and
            that's ok. It's about being persistent and trusting the process that
            if you keep trying that you will have that ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment when things
            click into place.

            <strong>CONTROL FLOW AND LOOPS</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Control flow and loops are concepts that are fundamental not just in
            JavaScript, but in nearly every programming language. They are an
            incredibly powerful tool that help us direct which code runs and how
            things are repeated.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements
            in a script (or whether statements are executed at all). An example
            that is close to my heart is choosing what to eat on a Sunday night.
            If I feel like something dirty and cheap I'll get McDonalds, maybe I
            feel like dumplings so I'll get Xian Food Bar, or maybe I'll be
            boring and want something healthy and make something at home.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Loops on the other hand are focused on repeating actions, an example
            that comes to mind is going to the gym. I have a list of exercises
            in my workout, for each of those exercises I complete a specific
            number of sets before moving onto the next exercise (technically for
            each set in each exercise I then perform a nested loop with a number
            of reps, but nested loops are a discussion for another time
            #bigOnotation).

            <strong>THE DOM üëë</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            The DOM or Document Object Model (DOM) is a structure for
            representing web pages. It's like a map of a web page, that gives us
            as developers a way of changing it's content and style. All of the
            elements on a page (e.g. tables, images, text, buttons) are parts of
            the DOM, which are essential for using tools like CSS and
            JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            With JavaScript, we can use the DOM to change how a button looks
            when a user hovers their mouse over it, or maybe respond in a
            specific way when they submit a form on our website. With CSS, it
            provides the HTML elements that we style, but it also provides the
            HTML properties that we use for CSS selectors.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            In other words, the DOM links the structure of a page (HTML), with
            the styles we apply (CSS), and the interactions we add (JavaScript).
            It was designed to be independent of any particular programming
            language, so that developers have a single, consistent framework for
            interacting with web pages. Even though JavaScript is the main
            language that we use for this, you can even use Python to manipulate
            the DOM!

        <!-- SECTION 4: ARRAYS AND OBJECTS -->
        <section class="flex col blog-sctn">
          <h3 class="blog-sctn-head">
            <strong>ARRAYS AND OBJECTS</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Arrays and objects are two common ways of storing information in
            JavaScript and other programming languages. For these to be useful
            we need to know how to access the data inside them!
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Arrays are like a list of items e.g.
            <code
              >let favouriteRestaurants = [ 'mcdonalds', 'kfc', 'burgerking'
              ]</code
            >. Each item in an array is assigned an index, starting at 0. Array
            indexes start at 0 because the first position is treated as the
            starting point (don't overthink it too much). We can then use these
            indexes to access items inside our array using bracket notation. For
            example if we come back to our previous example,
            <code>favouriteRestaurants[0]</code> would give us
            <code>'mcdonalds'</code>, and
            <code>favouriteRestaurants[2]</code> would give us
            <code>'burgerking'</code>.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Objects on the other hand have what we call keys and values. A key
            is like a label or name, and the value is the information stored
            under that label. e.g.
            <code
              >let myHero = { firstName: 'Ronald', lastName: 'McDonald' }</code
            >. The most common way for accessing data inside an object is to use
            dot notation to access the value of a specific key, for example
            <code>myHero.firstName</code> would give us <code>'Ronald'</code>.
            However in some cases you might not know the key you need to access
            until the program is running, and in these cases we can use bracket
            notation like we do in arrays. This is also helpful if the key you
            need to access is not a valid variable name. An example of using
            bracket notation with our object would look like
            <code>myHero['lastName']</code> would give us
            <code>'McDonald'</code>.

            <strong>WHY FUNCTIONS ARE COOL</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Writing a function in JavaScript is like writing yourself a set of
            instructions that you can reuse. Instead of writing the same steps
            over and over again, you can put them inside a function and just use
            that instead. There are a few key reasons why functions are helpful:
