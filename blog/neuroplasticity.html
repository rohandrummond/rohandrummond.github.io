            How do I scientifically approach learning I hear you ask? The Growth
            Mindset and Neuroplasticity are 2 hugely beneficial concepts to
            understand for anyone who wants to optimise their learning.

            <strong>GROWTH MINDSETS AND THE POWER OF "YET"</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Growth mindsets are relevant to anyone trying to achieve something
            in their life, but particularly to people trying to learn a new
            skill. A growth mindset is the belief that a person's capacities and
            talents can be improved over time. The term was coined by Stanford
            psychologist Carol Dweck, I found her
            <a

            >
            about the topic extremely interesting. It was mind-blowing to hear
            how much of an impact growth mindsets had when implemented in early
            childhood learning.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Something that really resonated with me when learning about growth
            mindsets is ‚Äúembracing the power of yet‚Äù. It wasn't necessarily a
            surprise or change in my thinking, but I definitely hadn't heard it
            put in those words. I think it's a really healthy way to think about
            anything in life, not just learning. The idea that learning is a
            trajectory, not just something that is fail or pass. Just because we
            can't do something now, doesn't mean we can't be successful in the
            future.
          </p>
          <p class="body-txt">
            I think the main thing that I will be integrating into my learning
            journey, is being very mindful about how I process the meaning of
            effort and difficulty. Instead of seeing challenges as negative, I'm
            going to do my best to frame them as a way to improve. Rather than
            the end result I'll be focusing on effort, strategy and progress.

          <p class="body-txt">
            Neuroplasticty is the brain‚Äôs ability to adapt and change through
            the formation of new neural pathways. Understanding this concept is
            important because it means realising that we can always improve our
            knowledge, skills and habits regardless of what age we are. It
            encourages persistence and repetition, because we know that this
            will help reshape our brain.

            Engaging with the concept of neuroplasticity looks different for
            everyone, but some of the overarching principles that are important
            to keep top of mind are:
