          <p class="body-txt">
            The first formal academic definition of emotional intelligence was
            included in Peter Salovey and John Mayer's 1990 study called
            “Emotional Intelligence. In layman's terms they defined it as a set
            of skills that include:

          </ul>
          <p class="body-txt">
            Even though the study is 25 years old, the definition remains mostly
            unchanged.

              >Psychology Today</a
            >
            defines it as including a “…a few skills: namely emotional
            awareness, or the ability to identify and name one's own emotions;
            the ability to harness those emotions and apply them to tasks like
            thinking and problem solving; and the ability to manage emotions,
            which includes both regulating one's own emotions when necessary and
            helping others to do the same.”

            Before looking at the difference between EQ and IQ, it's first
            important to define IQ. The

              >Collin's dictionary</a
            >
            defines Intelligence Quotient (IQ) as "a measure of the intelligence
            of an individual derived from results obtained from specially
            designed tests”. Basically it's traditional definition is a score
            that measures how “smart” someone is, but that definition of smart
            is centred around reasoning, memory and problem solving. However
            nowadays it's used more loosely to refer to someone's general
            intelligence, even when no formal test score is involved.

            written by Dovetail summed it up pretty well - “While IQ primarily
            measures cognitive abilities such as logical reasoning,
            problem-solving, and analytical skills, EQ refers to your aptitude
            for understanding and managing emotions, empathising with others,
            and building effective interpersonal relationships”.

            see's it as one of the most sought-after skills in the workplace,
            with 71% of employers valuing emotional intelligence more than
            technical skills when evaluating candidates. They also talk about
            how it is an especially important quality in leaders, as it is
            crucial for fostering positive team dynamics, empathy and
            collaboration.

            in Iran also found that emotional intelligence was a predictive
            factor in happiness. The study of 300 medical students found that
            those with higher levels of EQ were better able to understand and
            regulate their emotions, leading to reduced stress, burnout and
            anxiety - all factors that lead to increased happiness. Also,
            students were able to form stronger interpersonal relationships,
            another thing that lead to an increased sense of wellbeing.
